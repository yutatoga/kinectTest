kinectTest 1
>> sample code from https://github.com/ofTheo/ofxKinectV2

kinectTest2
>> point cloud with kinect raw depth data

kinectTest3
>> drawing triangle mesh with kinect raw depth data

kinectTest4
>> same feature with kinectTest3 but calculating indexes for triangles(almost same speed with kinectTest3??) 

kinectTest5
>> draw triangle mesh with kinect raw depth data only in the depth range.

kinectTest6
>> save all vertexes to mesh and make triangle with depth data only in the depth range

kinectTest7
>> use bullet and make ofxBulletTriMeshShape with kinectMesh
